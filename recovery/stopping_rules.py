"""
stopping_rules.py — the guard every intervention passes through immediately
before it fires.

The decision engine already applies stopping rules at *decision* time. This
module re-applies them at *execution* time, which is a different moment and
can produce a different answer: a customer may have paid, or been contacted
by another tier, in between. The brief calls this out explicitly — check
`status == 'recovered'` at execution time, not just decision time.

Outcomes:
  ALLOW   -> fire the intervention
  STOP    -> do not fire, terminal. Intervention is marked 'skipped'.
  DEFER   -> do not fire, but try again on the next run (outside the call
             window). Intervention stays 'pending'.

Every non-ALLOW result is written to audit_log by the caller, so a judge can
see the rule that fired and why.
