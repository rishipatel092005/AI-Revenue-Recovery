"""
auto_retry_executor.py — fires the cheapest tier: a silent gateway retry.

Tier 1 of 3. No customer contact at all, so it never counts against the
3-attempt cap. The decision engine routes retryable failures (bank timeout,
processing error, network error) here on their first attempt, because
re-presenting the charge costs nothing and a meaningful share of them
simply go through the second time.

The gateway call itself is a STUB — the brief rules out a real payment
gateway integration, so this simulates the re-presentment deterministically
(seeded from the transaction id) rather than calling Razorpay. When a
simulated retry succeeds at the gateway the money is genuinely in, so the
transaction is marked recovered and credited to the auto_retry tier. Every
one of those rows is stamped `simulated: true` in the audit trail.

Usage:
  python auto_retry_executor.py
