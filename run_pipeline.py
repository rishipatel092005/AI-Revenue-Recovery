run_pipeline.py — the whole agent, end to end, in one command.

    python run_pipeline.py

Runs the four stages in cost order, which is the same order a judge should
read them in:

    1. decide      every failed transaction gets a tier + a one-sentence
                   reason, both written to audit_log
    2. auto_retry  silent gateway re-presentment, no customer contact
    3. whatsapp    low-cost templated nudge with a payment link
    4. voice_call  Hinglish promise-to-pay call, structured result captured

Every stage re-checks the stopping rules immediately before it fires
anything, and every stage honours DRY_RUN (default true).

Flags:
    --force        re-decide transactions that already have a pending
                   intervention (default: leave them alone, so running this
                   twice never double-contacts anyone)
    --skip-decide  execute pending interventions only
